## Description

In curve fitting, the given points can be treated as one chunk that fits one polynomial, or small chunks, each to be fit into a
different polynomial. 

---

## Features

Curve Fitting And Interpolation: 

- Open and display an CSV signal such as (ECG,EMG..)
- choose numbers of chuncks of signal.
- Choose the order of the fitting polynomial 
- The fitted equation and percentage error are shown in its mathematical form above the main graph
- The extrapolation efficacy,choose 50%,60%...of signal to apply this
- Can generate an error map for the fitting process 
- Choose the x- and y- axis of the error map among number of chunks, order of the fitting polynomial, and overlapping between consecutive chunks.
